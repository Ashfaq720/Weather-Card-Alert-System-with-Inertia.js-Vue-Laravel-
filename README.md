# Weather Dashboard with Inertia.js (Vue + Laravel)

A modern Weather Dashboard built using **Laravel**, **Inertia.js**, and **Vue.js**.  
It displays **Weather Cards**, **Weather Types**, and **Alerts** in a clean and interactive UI.

> Note: The project is designed to fetch real-time weather data from a weather API.  
> If the API is not working, the dashboard still functions with mock/demo data.
